   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

4. **Install pre-commit hooks (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit

## 🧪 Running Tests

### Run all tests:
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Run specific test files:
```bash
pytest tests/test_azure_pricing.py -v
```

### Run linters:
```bash
# Format code
black src/ tests/

# Check with Ruff
ruff check src/ tests/

# Type checking
mypy src/
```

### Run pre-commit checks manually:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## 📝 Code Style

We follow these guidelines:

- **PEP 8** for Python code style
- **Black** for code formatting (line length: 120)
- **Ruff** for linting
- **MyPy** for type checking
- **Type hints** for all function parameters and return values
- **Docstrings** for public functions and classes

### Example:
```python
async def search_prices(
    service_name: str,
    region: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: int = 50
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Search Azure retail prices with filters.
    
    Args:
        service_name: The Azure service to search for
        region: Optional region filter
        limit: Maximum number of results
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing search results and metadata
    """
    # Implementation here
