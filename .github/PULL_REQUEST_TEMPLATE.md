## Token / latency impact (Plan 01 Phase 5)

<!--
Does this PR change input-token budget or per-turn latency for any
agent or subagent? Default answer is NO — only opt in when you've
changed agent bodies, skills, instructions, model assignments, or
review-loop behaviour.
-->

This change affects input-token budget / per-call latency:

- [ ] YES (provide a magnitude estimate below)
- [ ] NO

If YES, expected impact:

<!-- e.g. "~30 K input tokens saved per Step 1 (askQuestions batching)" -->

## Workflow Used
